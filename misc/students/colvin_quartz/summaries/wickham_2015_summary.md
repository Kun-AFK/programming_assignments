Statistics as a field doesn't like independent/amateur statisticians. This 
article argues that instead of looking down on amateur statisticians, we 
should give them the tools to succeed. One good way to do this is to develop 
the tools and explain them in undergrad statistics classes. These teaching 
tools include accessible data analysis grammars that are both flexible and 
constraining, and teaching students to program.
