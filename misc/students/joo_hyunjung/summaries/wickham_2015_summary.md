# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

For statistics curriculum, we should not prefer an abstinence-based approach, which requires us to do statistics only in a professional way, not in an amateur way. Rather, we should provide a statistics curriculum that is easy to approach, but safe and practical at the same time. One way is to develop grammars of data analysis in both flexible and constrained ways, so that students can actually solve various problems on their own, while still being on track. In order to learn these grammars, student must start learning a programming language in their statistics curriculum, so that they can readily use and then develop it more creatively.
