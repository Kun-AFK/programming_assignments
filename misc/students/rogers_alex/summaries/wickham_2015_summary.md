The Wickham (2015) article is essentially a call for a change in the field of Statistics. Wickham says that the field needs to adapt to modern times, and proposes a couple ways to do this. First is the development of "safe-stats", which if I'm understanding correctly are basically just an entry-level way of teaching statistics to ameteurs. He follows that by stating that aspiring statisticians must, by necessity, learn to program, and that this is doable in even the first stats classes.
