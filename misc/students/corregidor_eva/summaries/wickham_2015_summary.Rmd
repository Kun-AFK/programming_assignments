**Summary of Wickham, 2015**
In his article, Wickham aims to convince the reader about the importance of changing the statistics curriculum for higher education. Wickham acknowledges the importance of teaching students the grammar of data analysis. For him, rethinking the way stats is taught would make data analysis more accessible to less-proficient users. This switch would help students to solve present and future problems around the data ocean.
