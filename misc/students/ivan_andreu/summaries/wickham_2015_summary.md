# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

The proposed article makes a panoramic introduction to the field of statistics and coding. 
The author talks about the concept of "grammars in data science" in where the knowledge needed to solve two problems can be transferable to solve a third one by recombining pieces of the two original problems. 
In this way grammars in data science need to be flexible and constraining at the same time, being regulated by a coding language.
