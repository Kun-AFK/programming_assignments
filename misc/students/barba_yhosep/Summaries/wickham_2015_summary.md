Wickham builds on George Cobb's idea that the statistics curriculum needs to be rethought or redesigned. He emphasizes that statistics
shouldn't be reserved for experts only. Instead, it should be framed as an accessible discipline with practical tools that
anyone can use. In order to do this, Wichkham talks about "grammar for statistics", a framework that helps students with tools
to solve most of their problems. This methodolofy brings hands-on examples and practical applications, so students can develop
their skills. In the end, the author recommend to bring real data to tackle real-world data challenges.
