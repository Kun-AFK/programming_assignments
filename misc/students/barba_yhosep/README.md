I do not have a personal website.
In this class,I aim to understand the simple concepts of statistics to apply to my research project.I’m also hoping to gain insight into why researchers select specific analysis models based on their research questions and/or objectives.Additionally,I’d like to improve my ability to interpret data, plots, and results.
