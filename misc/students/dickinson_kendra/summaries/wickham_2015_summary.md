# Wickham (2015) Summary

There has long been the tendency for novices to be encouraged to abstain from statistical analysis. The author proposes that instead of encouraging abstinence from statistics, what we need instead is a framework, not unlike a grammar, comprised of the essential components and processes to meet the functional needs of amateur statistics users. Furthermore, the author proposes that such a framework must be embedded in a programing language in order to both allow for flexibility and impose constraints. Therefore, students must be taught to program, an entirely achievable goal even in an introductory statistics course, so that they can be guided to better working with data and understanding data analysis.
