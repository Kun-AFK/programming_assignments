Wickham's article is about re-orientating the teaching of statistics -- since it is impossible for 
students to stay away from experimenting with statistics, what is essential is providing students
with the tools needed in order to practice safe-stats. He states that teaching methods must include 
grammars of data analysis -- that is, a set of rules, or a framework, that students can use in order 
to solve an array of problems. He states that this grammar must be simultaneously flexible and 
constraining -- it cannot offer too much freedom. To that end, in order for students to learn an 
appropriate grammar to do statistical analysis, they must be taught to program -- and that this must 
be an essential part of the undergraduate statistics curriculum.
