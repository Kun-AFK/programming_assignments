# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

Four sentence summary goes here:
-The article begins by saying that the current state of 
statistics is at serious risk of becoming irrelevant,
denying the current emphasis on correctness in teaching 
while ignoring its effectiveness.
-The article argues that the traditional "Abstinence" approach to statistics education 
means that people can only perform data analysis under 
the guidance of professional statisticians, otherwise they may make mistakes.
-However, in reality, many people will try to analyze data on their own,
so it is better to provide safer and easier-to-use tools and methods
so that more people can use statistical methods scientifically.
-Lower the learning threshold and make statistics easier to understand and experiment with.
