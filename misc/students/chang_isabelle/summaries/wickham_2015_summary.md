Statistics can (and should!) be taught beyond the realms of a statistics degree. It's a skill that should be taught to students: initially with frameworks and guidance, but in such a way that encourages the exploration, trial, and error of new techniques and/or ideas. These guidelines should have some degree of flexibility, but not too much, and as such should be implemented within the context of a programming language. As such, programming is also an essential skill when it comes to teaching statistics.
