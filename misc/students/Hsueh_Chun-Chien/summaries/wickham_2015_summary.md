# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

This article focuses on teaching students to use statistical skills safely rather than simply avoiding mistakes. The author argues that abstinence-based approaches to teaching statistics are ineffective, as students need practical data analysis skills. Teaching flexible yet constrained grammar, such as the grammar of graphics, can help students solve most data-related problems. Effective teaching should strike a balance between flexibility and constraints and teach students to make correct statistical decisions.
