\f0\fs24 \cf0 The field of statistics needs to be rethought and leave behind the abstinence-based approach. To do so, tools need to be attractive and easy to understand for the students. For that, a grammar of data analysis needs to be developed, and it needs to be flexible and constraining. For this, a grammar needs to be embedded in a programming language, which implies that statistics students need to be taught how to program. Students need to learn the skills to swim into the data ocean.}
