## Assignment 1

**Topic**: GitHub

### Overview

In this assignment you will practice the basics of working with project
repos using GitHub and the GitHub desktop app. Specifically, you will
fork this repo, clone it to your computer, contribute to it, push
changes from your local repo (your computer) to your upstream branch
(your forked copy on GitHub), and, finally, submit a pull request to
merge your contribution with the master repo (the professor’s copy).

**Assigned**: Week 1  
**Due**: Monday, 01/30 before 10pm

### Instructions

1.  If you have not already done so, fork this repo and clone it to your
    computer.
2.  In your local copy create a personal ‘dropbox’
    1.  create an empty folder named “lastname\_firstname” (ex.
        casillas\_joseph). Put it inside `misc > students`.
    2.  create another **README.md** file and place it inside your
        personal folder. Include the following info:
        -   Your name
        -   Your email
        -   Your personal website if you have one
        -   A goal you have for this class
3.  Create another folder. Name it `summaries` and place it inside your
    personal dropbox folder. Next, read [Wickham,
    2015](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/mererenovation/17_Wickham.PDF).
    Create a file called **wickham\_2015\_summary.md** and write a 4
    sentence summary about the article. Save this file in `summaries`
    inside your personal dropbox (the lastname\_firstname folder you
    just made).
4.  Read [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) Preface - Ch. 2
    (p. ix-41). Do all examples included in the text as you read
    (nothing to turn in).
5.  Read QML Ch. 1 (pp. 1-33). Do the R examples included in the text as
    you read (nothing to turn in).
6.  Commit the changes to your upstream branch, i.e., your copy of the
    repo on github.com. Check your repo on GitHub to make sure it
    worked, and then submit a pull-request. It should include the
    following…
    1.  your dropbox folder (lastname\_firstname)
    2.  a README.md file
    3.  a summaries folder (inside your dropbox)
    4.  your Wickham (2015) summary (wickham\_2015\_summary.md)

### Evaluation

This is programming assignment 1 of 4. It is worth 10 of the 40 possible
points. In order to receive full credit you must complete steps 1-6
above and follow all the instructions.

### Tips

This is how the file structure currently looks:

    programming_assignments
           │
           ├── README.md
           └── misc
               └── students
                   ├── README.md
                   └── firstname_lastname
                       ├── README.md
                       └── summaries
                           └── wickham_2015_summary.md

Take a look inside the `lastname_firstname` folder if you need an
example (this is highly recommended). Your personal dropbox should look
exactly the same, but with your information, summaries, etc. In other
words, you will add a folder inside `students` that looks like this (I
am using my name, you will use your name):

    casillas_joseph
            │
            ├── README.md
            └── summaries
                └── wickham_2015_summary.md

Remember to check the [GitHub setup
tutorial](https://www.ds4ling.jvcasillas.com/misc/tutorials/github_setup/)
if you need help pushing your changes and submitting a pull request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 2

**Topics**: RMarkdown, ggplot

### Overview

In this assignment you will practice the basics of using .Rmd files to
create dynamic, reproducible reports in .docx, .pdf, or .html format.
Moreover, you will show your data visualization skills using `ggplot2`.

**Assigned**: Week 3  
**Due**: Monday, 2/13 before 10pm

### Instructions

1.  Fetch the latest updates in `programming_assignments` to your forked
    branch and pull the changes to your local copy (i.e., the copy on
    your computer). Review the [GitHub setup
    tutorial](https://www.ds4ling.jvcasillas.com/misc/tutorials/github_setup/)
    if you need a refresher.
2.  Create a folder, `pa2`, inside your personal
    dropbox.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
3.  In RStudio create an RMarkdown file called `README.Rmd` and put it
    inside the `pa2` folder.
4.  Use the following information for the **yaml front matter**:

<!-- -->

    title: "Programming assignment 2"  
    author: "Your name"  
    date: "Last update: `r Sys.time()`"  
    output:  
      html_document:  
        highlight: kate  
        keep_md: yes  
        theme: united

1.  Install and load the `languageR` package from CRAN.
2.  Familiarize yourself with three of the following five datasets:
    -   **beginningReaders**
    -   **danish**
    -   **dativeSimplified**
    -   **english**
    -   **spanishFunctionWords**
3.  Inside your `README.Rmd` file you will generate 3 different plots
    using `ggplot2`. You must use 3 of the aforementioned datasets (a
    different dataset for each plot). All plots must include informative
    x-, y-axis labels and a title. The plots you must create are:
    1.  A bivariate scatterplot
    2.  A boxplot with different fill colors
    3.  A plot of your choice that includes a `stat_summary` and a
        facet.
4.  Commit the changes in your dropbox to your upstream branch, i.e.,
    your forked copy on github. Check your repo on GitHub.com to make
    sure it worked (notice anything cool when you check the `pa2`
    folder?), and then submit a pull-request to the
    `ds4ling/programming_assignments` master repo. It should include the
    following…
5.  your `pa2` folder
6.  your `README.Rmd` RMarkdown file (and probably a few others)
7.  3 plots created using `ggplot`

### Evaluation

This is programming assignment 2 of 5. It is worth 10 of the 50 possible
points. In order to receive full credit you must complete all the steps
above and follow all the instructions.

### Tips

Review Ch. 1 of R4DS for help with `ggplot`. **DO NOT** copy the plots
directly from the book or the internet (I’ll know). Review the [GitHub
setup
tutorial](https://www.ds4ling.jvcasillas.com/misc/tutorials/github_setup/),
especially if you are struggling with git-specific terminology. Pay
special attention to file names, letter case, etc. in order to get the
appropriate results.

This is more or less how your dropbox should look (**Note**: your pa2
folder will have a little more detail than what I have described here.
That is fine):

    casillas_joseph
            │
            ├── README.md
            ├── summaries
            │    └── r4ds_ch1_summary.md
            └── pa2
                 └── README.Rmd

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: Note: you might have noticed that your
current copy of `programming_assignments` now includes the dropbox
folders of your classmates. This is on purpose. You are encouraged to
review your classmates assignments. You can learn from them and you will
notice that it is possible to solve data science problems using a
variety of different methods. That being said, you should only review
the work of your classmates **after** the assignment has been turned in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 3

**Topics**: Project management, Tidying data, GitHub Pages

### Overview

In this assignment you will create your own RStudio project in which you
get, tidy, transform and plot data from a publicly available dataset.
You will host your project in a GitHub repo and create a project
website.

**Assigned**: Week 5, 02/20  
**Due**: Monday, 02/27 before 10pm

### Instructions

Choose any data set you want from the `languageR` package (it can be the
same one you used last week). To see all the options, run the following
code in RStudio:

    data(package = "languageR")

#### Setup

1.  Create a new repo from GitHub.com called `pa3` and clone it to your
    desktop.
2.  Create a new project for your repo using RStudio.
3.  Inside your new project, create an RMarkdown document called
    `index.Rmd` (the default output format should be html).

#### EDA

1.  Load the data set of your choice and get information about its
    structure (remember all code needs to be inside a knitr code chunk).
2.  Tidy the data set (every variable gets a column, every observation
    occupies a single row), if necessary.
3.  Calculate descriptive statistics of your choice.
4.  Select two continuous variables and fit a model to the data
    (bivariate regression).
5.  Generate a plot that includes a regression line.
6.  Write up some general observations (1-2 paragraphs max)

#### Share

1.  Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
2.  Publish your repo using GitHub Pages.
3.  Update your fork of the `programming_assignments` repo. Next, create
    a new folder inside **your** dropbox in `programming_assignments`
    called `pa3`. Include a README.md file with a link to your published
    pa3 website. Submit a pull request to the master
    `programming_assignments` repo.

### Evaluation

This is programming assignment 3 of 5. It is worth 10 of the 50 possible
points. In order to receive full credit you must complete all steps in
**Setup**, **EDA**, and **Share** detailed above, and follow **all** the
instructions. Moreover, steps 1-5 in *EDA* **must** be completed in
separate code chunks, and you must comment every step in your code.

### Tips

-   Review the RStudio Projects tutorial to refresh your memory.
-   Review the recommended readings for tips on tidying your data.
-   Only submit a pull request to `programming_assignments` once
    everything is working properly in your repo.
-   Always include a README in your repos.
-   Make sure you **look** at the output after knitting. Is it clean?
    Make it look good (i.e., don’t type everything in bold!).
-   **Use slack to ask questions**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 4

**Topics**: Project management, tidying data, HTML Presentations

### Overview

In this assignment you will create an RStudio project in which you get,
tidy, transform, analyze and plot data from a publicly available
dataset. You will host your project in a GitHub repo and create HTML
slides to present your analysis.

**Assigned**: 03/20  
**Due**: Monday, 03/27 before 10pm

### Instructions

1.  Create a new project in RStudio called `pa4`. Inside your new
    project, create three folders: `data_raw`, `data_tidy`, and
    `slides`.
2.  Download the dataset available
    [here](https://github.com/ds4ling/programming_assignments/raw/master/misc/data/pa_4_data/fricatives.zip)
    and store it in `data_raw`.
3.  Generate an HTML presentation using **xaringan**. Save the RMarkdown
    file as `index.Rmd` inside of the folder `slides`.
4.  Load the dataset from inside your `index.Rmd` file.
5.  Tidy the data and save the tidy version as a .csv file in
    `data_tidy`.
6.  Provide a table of descriptive statistics.
7.  Make a boxplot of center of gravity as a function of phoneme. In
    another slide, plot skewness as a function of phoneme. Use a
    statistical transformation (i.e., not a boxplot, but rather
    `stat_summary()`).
8.  Fit a model that examines center of gravity as a function of
    skewness for the \[s\] segments (hint: you will have to transform
    the data). Make a table of the model summary.
9.  Make a scatter plot that illustrates the relationship in (8).
10. Check model diagnostics (make plots).
11. Write up the results (as if it were for a journal article).
12. In a new slide, load the `assumptions.csv` dataset. Make a
    scatterplot. Explain in a few sentences why it would not be
    appropriate to fit a model to this data.
13. Host your project in a GitHub repo called `pa4`.
14. Turn the slides into a website using GitHub pages.
15. Inside your dropbox in `programming_assignments`, create a folder
    called `pa4` that includes a `README.md` file with a link to your
    slides.
16. Push changes to your forked version of `programming_assignments` and
    submit a pull request to the master `programming_assignments` repo
    in ds4ling.

### Evaluation

This is programming assignment 4 of 5. It is worth 10 of the 50 possible
points. In order to receive full credit you must complete steps 1-16

### Tips

-   Follow every instruction step-by-step.
-   Worry about tidying your data, fitting your models, making plots,
    etc., **before** you worry about making the presentation (i.e.,
    making each individual slide). It might be a good idea to use an R
    script first, as we have done in class, and then turn it into a
    presentation.
-   Search for help when you get stuck, use stackoverflow and slack, not
    Patrick.
-   Think of this PA as a practice exam. Use all of the skills you have
    developed up to this point in the class.
-   Review fetching changes in GitHub (to update your
    **programming\_assignments** repo) and submitting pull-requests (to
    ‘turn in’ your assignment).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 5

**Topics**: Project management, tidying data, fitting linear models,
testing hypotheses, reporting results.

### Overview

In this assignment you will create an RStudio project in which you load,
tidy, transform, plot, analyze and report data. You will host your
project on GitHub in a personal repo and create a report (word doc) to
present your analysis.

**Assigned**: 04/03  
**Due**: 04/10 by 10:00 pm

### Background

You are interested in researching how different people learn a second
language. You have collected the data in `lang_data_raw.csv`.
Specifically, you are interested in determining if it is easier/harder
to learn an L2 based on age, and language aptitude. You hypothesize that
younger people learn languages better than older people (for the sake of
this exercise assume that younger implies before puberty and older
implies over 20 years old). Moreover, you think age interacts with
language aptitude, that is, some people are just better at learning
languages, regardless of the age at which they learn. To test your
hypotheses, you have given 200 language learners a proficiency test. You
also have data regarding their iq and a measurement of overall
motivation (for the sake of this exercise also assume that language
aptitude can be assessed with just iq and motivation). Previous
literature on the subject utilizes iq and motivation data to create a
composite language learning ability metric. You need to create this
metric for all of the models you will fit (instructions below). In sum,
you want to know if proficiency scores vary as a function of age
(younger/older) and composite aptitude score.

### Instructions

1.  Get the latest version of `programming_assignments`, i.e., fetch the
    newest changes to update your local repo.
2.  Create a new project in RStudio called `pa5`. Inside your new
    project, create two folders: `data_raw` and `data_clean`.
3.  Download the dataset available
    [here](https://github.com/ds4ling/programming_assignments/raw/master/misc/data/pa_5_data/pa_5_data.zip)
    and store the entire folder in `data_raw`.  
4.  Create a new RMarkdown file called `index.Rmd` (‘index’ is *not*
    capitalized) and save it at the root level of your project (i.e.,
    inside `pa5`). The output of the Rmd file should be a word document.
    You can use the `papaja` package to generate an APA formatted
    manuscript if you’d like. If you choose not to use `papaja`, the
    yaml front matter of your document should have the “output” set to
    `word_document`. Be sure to give an informative title and to include
    your name.
5.  Load the dataset from inside your `index.Rmd` file. Pay special
    attention to the path. Don’t forget where the .csv file lives. Print
    the first 6 rows of the dataframe (make sure `echo=TRUE` in all
    knitr code chunks).
6.  Tidy the dataset as necessary to run your models and plot your data.
    Keep in mind the principles of tidy data. Use sections, text,
    comments, etc. to explain in prose every step of the tidying
    process.
7.  Create a new column in the dataset for the composite language
    learning score by taking the log of iq divided by 80 plus the log of
    motivation (note: the `log()` function will be useful. See `?log`
    for more info). Call this variable `composite_score`. After you have
    created this variable, you can standardize or center it if you want
    (i.e., create z-scores, or subtract the mean from each value), but
    this is not obligatory.
8.  Provide a table of descriptive statistics. You decide what is
    relevant based on the variables you have and your hypotheses.
    Include an explanation in prose of any observations you make from
    the table. Be sure to print the table in a way that will show up in
    your knitted document (see previous examples from class).
9.  Create an informative plot of the data. You only get one plot, so
    make it count. Keep in mind the types of variables that you have,
    particularly those that are relevant to your hypotheses. Interpret
    the plot (in prose).
10. Again, you are interested in determining if proficiency scores vary
    as a function of `age` and `composite_score`. Fit the appropriate
    model. Test the two-way interaction, the main effect of `age`, and
    the main effect of `composite_score` using nested model comparisons.
11. Print a summary of the best model and test that the model
    assumptions have been met (you can use plots for this, but you are
    not required to include them in the final version of your
    assignment).
12. Write up the results. You should include (1) a description of the
    statistical analyses you have done in one paragraph, and (2) the
    actual interpretation of the results in another (see class slides
    for examples). Don’t forget to include an overall assessment of
    goodness of fit (variance explained).
13. Once you have finished steps 1-12, make sure your documents will
    knit successfully. Read that last sentence again. Host your project
    in a **private** GitHub repo (call it `pa5`), and share it with me
    (jvcasillas). You can share a private repo from the settings tab on
    github.com (essentially you add me as a contributor). You do not
    need to make it a website.
14. Create a new folder in your `programming_assignments` dropbox
    folder. Include a `README.md` file with a link to your repo (just
    the repo, not a website).
15. Celebrate. You survived. So far.
